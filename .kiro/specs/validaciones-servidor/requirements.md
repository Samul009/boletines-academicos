# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document specifies the requirements for improving the validation system of the Academic Bulletin Server. The system currently handles academic data including grades, attendance, users, and bulletin generation, but needs enhanced validation to ensure data integrity, business rule compliance, and security.

## Glossary

- **Sistema_Boletines**: The Academic Bulletin Management System
- **Usuario_Docente**: Teacher user who can input grades for their assigned subjects
- **Usuario_Administrador**: Administrator user who can input grades for any teacher and manage system data
- **Calificacion**: Academic grade with numeric value between 0.0 and 5.0
- **Periodo_Academico**: Academic period within a school year
- **Matricula_Activa**: Active student enrollment in a specific group and academic year
- **Asignacion_Docente**: Teacher assignment to teach a specific subject to a specific group

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the system to validate all grade inputs, so that only valid academic data is stored in the database.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a grade is submitted, THE Sistema_Boletines SHALL validate that the numeric value is between 0.0 and 5.0
2. WHEN a grade is submitted for a student, THE Sistema_Boletines SHALL verify that the student has an active enrollment (Matricula_Activa) for the current academic year
3. WHEN a grade is submitted, THE Sistema_Boletines SHALL validate that the academic period (Periodo_Academico) is active or closed but not deleted
4. IF a grade already exists for the same student, subject, and period, THEN THE Sistema_Boletines SHALL update the existing record instead of creating a duplicate
5. WHEN importing grades from Excel, THE Sistema_Boletines SHALL validate each row and provide detailed error reports for invalid entries

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a teacher, I want the system to prevent me from entering grades for students or subjects I'm not authorized to teach, so that data integrity is maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Usuario_Docente submits a grade, THE Sistema_Boletines SHALL verify that the teacher has an active assignment (Asignacion_Docente) for that subject and group
2. WHEN a Usuario_Docente attempts to access student data, THE Sistema_Boletines SHALL verify that the students belong to groups assigned to that teacher
3. WHEN a Usuario_Administrador submits grades, THE Sistema_Boletines SHALL allow access to all subjects and groups regardless of teacher assignments
4. IF a teacher attempts to grade a student not in their assigned groups, THEN THE Sistema_Boletines SHALL reject the operation with a clear error message
5. WHEN accessing grade export/import functions, THE Sistema_Boletines SHALL filter data based on the user's authorized subjects and groups

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system user, I want all date-related operations to be validated, so that temporal data consistency is maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a grade registration date is submitted, THE Sistema_Boletines SHALL validate that the date is not in the future
2. WHEN an attendance record (Falla) is submitted, THE Sistema_Boletines SHALL validate that the absence date is within the current academic year
3. WHEN a new academic period is created, THE Sistema_Boletines SHALL validate that start date is before end date
4. WHEN a student enrollment date is submitted, THE Sistema_Boletines SHALL validate that the date is within the academic year boundaries
5. IF any date validation fails, THEN THE Sistema_Boletines SHALL provide specific error messages indicating the date constraint violation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive input sanitization and security validation, so that the system is protected from malicious inputs and unauthorized access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any text input is received, THE Sistema_Boletines SHALL sanitize the input to prevent SQL injection attacks
2. WHEN file uploads are processed, THE Sistema_Boletines SHALL validate file types, sizes, and content structure
3. WHEN API requests are received, THE Sistema_Boletines SHALL validate JWT tokens and verify user permissions for the requested operation
4. WHEN database queries are executed, THE Sistema_Boletines SHALL use parameterized queries to prevent injection attacks
5. IF any security validation fails, THEN THE Sistema_Boletines SHALL log the attempt and return appropriate error responses without exposing system details

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a data entry user, I want clear and helpful error messages when validation fails, so that I can quickly correct my inputs and complete my tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validation fails, THE Sistema_Boletines SHALL provide specific error messages in Spanish indicating what went wrong
2. WHEN multiple validation errors occur, THE Sistema_Boletines SHALL return all errors in a structured format
3. WHEN Excel import fails, THE Sistema_Boletines SHALL provide row-by-row error details with student identification
4. WHEN business rule violations occur, THE Sistema_Boletines SHALL explain the rule and suggest corrective actions
5. WHEN permission errors occur, THE Sistema_Boletines SHALL clearly indicate what permissions are required for the operation
